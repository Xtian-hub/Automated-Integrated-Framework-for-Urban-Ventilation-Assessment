# Automated-Integrated-Framework-for-Urban-Ventilation-Assessment
This study presents an integrated modeling framework for urban ventilation assessment during design. It combines the ​USS4C​ 3D mesh semantic segmentation network and ​USGR4C​ geometric reconstruction engine. Leveraging UAV-derived 3D textured meshes, the framework automates urban element extraction and CFD-ready mesh generation.
